## Open Data Product Specification 


**Name of project:** Open Data Product Specification

**Requested project maturity level:** Sandbox 

**Project description** 

The Open Data Product Specification is a vendor-neutral, open-source machine-readable data product metadata model. 
It defines the objects and attributes as well as the structure of digital data products. Open Data Product Specification 2.1 (ODPS) 
changes the data product metadata model towards a standalone model, which helps to decouple data product from the systems often 
directly associated with it. 

ODPS outlines the essential technical details of a data product, including its data pipeline, access mechanisms, 
data models utilized, data and service quality, and deployment strategies. Essentially, ODPS serves as a comprehensive guideline 
for creating, managing, and sharing data products, ensuring interoperability, standardization, and ease of use across 
various platforms and applications. With help of the ODPS 2.1 data product can be presented and described to the customer also as such 
without any need for marketplace or other systems.

ODPS development includes also exploration of how to apply Everything as Code into the data product model. Experimental Data Quality of Service as Code
reusable component has been drafted. This standardized component could be used also for example in Data Contracts and would
increase the interoperability in the data economy.  

Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) first commit in GitHub to become a clearly defined open valuable standard was dated Dec 2, 2021. 
Over the last three years, ODPS has increasingly aligned with established standards. The latest production version of ODPS is 2.1 which was released on 22nd Aug 2023. 
The standard has long had a dedicated home in https://opendataproducts.org containing version details, use cases, and governance model.
 

**Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission**

ODPS aims are well aligned with the LF AI’s mission:

- enable interoperability between organizations, data platforms, data marketplaces, and tools.
- reduce data product metadata conversions and errors between systems and organizations,
- increase the speed of designing, testing, and implementing data products.
- speed up tools development around data product design, development and management.
- enable creation of automated data product deployment with standard methods (DataOps)
